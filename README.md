## ðŸš— About the Project

This project is a demo for managing track records, displaying race car lap times in a table & interactive grid (pun intended).

Users can:

- View and add lap times of different race cars.
- Switch to track mode to see an interactive visualization of the cars moving along a race circuit layout for comparison. 


This project is built with Laravel (backend) and Vue.js + TypeScript (frontend), using Vite for fast development.

Unit and Feature tests are included.

The API is built following the [JSON API](https://jsonapi.org/) specification.

[Zod](https://zod.dev/) is used on the frontend for validating responses from the API at runtime.
